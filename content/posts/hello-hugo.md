After too much time thinking about how to present my work, I decided to lean on Hugo. The generator is fast, version control friendly, and every part of the output can live in the same repository as my content.

This site uses a hand-rolled theme so I can tweak the markup with regular HTML and sprinkle in Hugo shortcodes when needed. If you want to run it locally, clone the repository and run `hugo server`. The command will watch for file changes and automatically refresh the browser.
