Hey, I'm Glen. I spend my days building software, coaching teams, and figuring out how to deliver value faster without breaking things in the process. This site is intentionally lightweight so I can jot down what I learn without fighting a CMS.

When I'm not writing code I'm usually outdoors with a camera or reading something related to systems thinking. If you'd like to connect you can always find me on GitHub or say hello on LinkedIn.
